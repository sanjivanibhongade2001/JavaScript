JSON is a format for storing and transporting data.
JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page. 
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
JSON is a lightweight data interchange format
JSON is language independent *
JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand          


                        JSON Example
{
"employees":[
  {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},
  {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
  {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
]
}


JSON Syntax Rules
Data is in name/value pairs
Data is separated by commas
Curly braces hold objects
Square brackets hold arrays
Ex.
"firstName":"John"



JSON Objects
JSON objects are written inside curly braces.

Just like in JavaScript, objects can contain multiple name/value pairs:

{"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"}



JSON Arrays
JSON arrays are written inside square brackets.

Just like in JavaScript, an array can contain objects:

"employees":[
  {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},
  {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
  {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
]
In the example above, the object "employees" is an array. It contains three objects.

Each object is a record of a person (with a first name and a last name).



Converting a JSON Text to a JavaScript Object
A common use of JSON is to read data from a web server, and display the data in a web page.

For simplicity, this can be demonstrated using a string as input.

First, create a JavaScript string containing JSON syntax:

let text = '{ "employees" : [' +
'{ "firstName":"John" , "lastName":"Doe" },' +
'{ "firstName":"Anna" , "lastName":"Smith" },' +
'{ "firstName":"Peter" , "lastName":"Jones" } ]}';
Then, use the JavaScript built-in function JSON.parse() to convert the string into a JavaScript object:

const obj = JSON.parse(text);
